  abstract = "Abstract Euler diagrams are a popular technique to visualize set-typed data. However, creating diagrams using simple shapes remains a challenging problem for many complex, real-life datasets. To solve this, we propose RectEuler: a flexible, fully-automatic method using rectangles to create Euler-like diagrams. We use an efficient mixed-integer optimization scheme to place set labels and element representatives (e.g., text or images) in conjunction with rectangles describing the sets. By defining appropriate constraints, we adhere to well-formedness properties and aesthetic considerations. If a dataset cannot be created within a reasonable time or at all, we iteratively split the diagram into multiple components until a drawable solution is found. Redundant encoding of the set membership using dots and set lines improves the readability of the diagram. Our web tool lets users see how the layout changes throughout the optimization process and provides interactive explanations. For evaluation, we perform quantitative and qualitative analysis across different datasets and compare our method to state-of-the-art Euler diagram generation methods.",

These intersecting elements can be connected among sets through visual links. These visual representations for the individual set, elements, and intersection in GridSet facilitate novel interaction approaches for undertaking analysis tasks by utilizing both macroscopic views of sets, as well as microscopic views of elements and attribute details. In order to perform multiple set operations, GridSet supports a simple and straightforward process for set operations through dragging and dropping set objects.

Our system then computes a metro map representation of $\mathcal{H}$, where each hyperedge $E$ in $\mathcal{S}$ corresponds to a metro line and each vertex corresponds to a metro station. Vertices that appear in two or more hyperedges are drawn as interchanges in the metro map, connecting the different sets. MetroSets is based on a modular 4-step pipeline which constructs and optimizes a path-based hypergraph support, which is then drawn and schematized using metro map layout algorithms. We propose and implement multiple algorithms for each step of the MetroSet pipeline and provide a functional prototype with easy-to-use preset configurations. Furthermore, using several real-world datasets, we perform an extensive quantitative evaluation of the impact of different pipeline stages on desirable properties of the generated maps, such as octolinearity, monotonicity, and edge uniformity.",

Motivated by a practical need articulated by corporate decision makers and limitations of existing visual representations, this research presents our journey in designing and implementing bicentric diagrams, a novel graph-based set visualization technique. A bicentric diagram enables simultaneous identification of sets, set relationships, and set member reach in integrated egonetworks of two focal entities. Our technique builds on the well-established sociological theory of tie strength to visually group and position nodes. We illustrate the broad applicability of bicentric diagrams with examples from four diverse sample domains: university collaboration, technology co-occurrence, health app purchases, and interfirm alliance networks. We assess the value of our technique using an expert-based evaluation approach.

A red-blue-purple spanning graph (RBP spanning graph) is a set of edges connecting the points such that the subgraph induced by the red and purple points is connected, and the subgraph induced by the blue and purple points is connected. We study the geometric properties of minimum RBP spanning graphs and the algorithmic problems associated with computing them. Specifically, we show that the general problem can be solved in polynomial time using matroid techniques.

Then, we place a matrix layout to visualize intersections among sets. Finally, by combining these two techniques, NetSet enables them to complement each other. The combination gives analysts both the overview and specific views of the data. Furthermore, NetSet provides both flexible exploration of a set system and quantitative analysis of set intersections. We conducted a case study to demonstrate how the combination can be successfully applied to real data, namely topic-talks data from the TED organization.",

As a result, it becomes challenging to visualize the temporal change in set membership of elements across several timesteps while showing individual set intersections. We propose Set Streams, a visualization technique that represents changing set structures on a timeline as branching and merging streams. The streams encode the changing membership of elements with set intersections. A query-based selection mechanism supports a flexible comparison of selected groups of elements across the temporal evolution. The main timeline view is complemented with additional panels to provide details about the elements.

Many analysis tasks targeted at set-typed data are concerned with these overlaps as salient features of such data. This paper presents Radial Sets, a novel visual technique to analyze set memberships for a large number of elements. Our technique uses frequency-based representations to enable quickly finding and analyzing different kinds of overlaps between the sets, and relating these overlaps to other attributes of the table entities. Furthermore, it enables various interactions to select elements of interest, find out if they are over-represented in specific sets or overlaps, and if they exhibit a different distribution for a specific attribute compared to the rest of the elements. These interactions allow formulating highly-expressive visual queries on the elements in terms of their set memberships and attribute values.

Another real-life application is the visualization of gene annotation, each gene product being annotated with several annotation terms indicating the associated biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components. In this paper, we present rainbow boxes, a novel technique for visualizing overlapping sets, and its application to the presentation of the properties of amino-acids, the comparison of drug properties, and the visualization of gene annotation. This technique requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem; we propose a specific heuristic and we evaluate and compare it to general optimization algorithms. We also describe a user study comparing rainbow boxes to tables and showing that the former allowed physicians to find information significantly faster. Finally, we discuss the limits and the perspectives of rainbow boxes.",

  abstract  = "This paper presents the first design principles that optimize the visualization of sets using linear diagrams. These principles are justified through empirical studies that evaluate the impact of graphical features on task performance. Linear diagrams represent sets using straight line segments, with line overlaps corresponding to set intersections. This study builds on recent empirical research, which establishes that linear diagrams can be superior to prominent set visualization techniques, namely Euler and Venn diagrams. We address the problem of how to best visualize overlapping sets using linear diagrams. To solve the problem, we investigate which graphical features of linear diagrams significantly impact user task performance. To this end, we conducted seven crowdsourced empirical studies involving a total of 1,760 participants. These studies allowed us to identify the following design principles, which significantly aid task performance: use a minimal number of line segments, use guidelines where overlaps start and end, and draw lines that are thin as opposed to thick bars. We also evaluated the following graphical properties that did not significantly impact task performance: color, orientation, and set order. The results are brought to life through a freely available software implementation that automatically draws linear diagrams with user-controlled graphical choices. An important consequence of our research is that users are now able to create effective visualizations of sets automatically, thus improving human--computer interaction.",

  abstract = "Set visualization is a well-known task in information visualization. In biology, it is used for comparing visually sets of genes or proteins, typically using Venn diagrams. However, limitations of the Venn diagram are well-known: they are limited to 6 sets and difficult to read above 4. Many other set visualization techniques have been proposed, but they have never been widely used in biology. In this paper, we introduce RainBio, a technique for visualizing sets in biology and aimed at providing a global overview showing the size of the main intersections, in a proportional way, and the similarities between sets. We adapt rainbow boxes, a technique for visualizing small datasets, to the visualization of larger sets, using element aggregation and intersection clustering. We present the application of RainBio to three datasets, with 5, 6 and 12 sets. We also describe a small user study comparing RainBio with Venn diagrams, involving 30 students in biology. Results showed that RainBio led to significantly fewer errors on 6-set dataset, and that the majority of students preferred RainBio. RainBio is proposed as a web-based tool for up to 15 sets.",
